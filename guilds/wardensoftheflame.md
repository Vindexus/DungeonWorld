## Custom Moves

When your party chooses you to beseech the guild for the necessary supplies for this quest, roll+CHA. On a 7-9 each member of your party can choose one item (no item may be taken twice):

 - One lembas bread for each party member (1 use, 0 weight, ration, +1 forward after eating it)
 - One bundle of arrows or javelins
 - Questing gear (2 uses, 1 weight, +1 forward the first time you use a piece of gear from it)
 - Bandages (3 Uses, Slow, 5 coins, 0 Weight)
 - 2 antitoxins
 - Messenger pigeon (1 use, 1 weight) - will fly back to the guild hall
 - Dagger, Knife, Shiv (1 weight, hand)

On a 10+ the same, and one member of your party (your choice) will be entrusted with a relic of the guild, to be returned upon the completion of the quest:

## Relics
 - Krozium’s Wrath - Longsword - +1 damage, close - On a 10+ with Hack & Slash your attack ignores armor
 - Bow of Night - Hunter’s Bow - +1 piercing, near - When you fire this bow you can choose to cast Darkness on the area it hits, expending one ammo
 - Bracers of Loktar - +1 armor against ranged attacks. When you Defy Danger against normal ranged attacks (spears, arrows, knives, etc), you can attempt to have the bracers deflect the attack and roll+STR or +CON.
 - The Iceglass - Shield - +1 armor, worn, 1 weight, clumsy (if your Strength is <15) - When you Defy Danger with the Iceglass, a 10+ will reflect magical attacks back at their source
