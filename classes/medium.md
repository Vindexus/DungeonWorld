# Medium
When you are possessed by a phantasm, or peer through the veil and converse with a spirit, you may consider the Medium a compendium class that is open to you. The next time you level up instead of taking a move from your class, you may add the Medium compendium class to your character and take its starting moves.

## Starting Moves
The Medium starts with these moves.

### Seance
When you take an hour to perform a ritual and open your body up to a spirit you have an affinity with, name the type of spirit that is entering your body. When you do so any spirit currently in your body vacates before the new one enters you. Your instability resets to 0.

### Spiritual Affinity
Your ability to seance is attuned to spirits of a certain nature. Choose two spirit types from the list below, and choose a new one each time you level up.

 - [ ] Guardian
 - [ ] Magi
 - [ ] Mender
 - [ ] Scholar
 - [ ] Sentinel
 - [ ] Scoundrel
 - [ ] Warrior

## Seized Intervention
When you use the spirit within you to guide you in an action associated with their domain, you perform any move as if you had rolled a 10+ and gain 1 instability.

## Retain Stability
Whenever you gain instability, you must fight to retain parity with the spirit inside you. Roll 2d6 and subtract your instability. On a 10+ you maintain the bond with the spirit within you. On a 7-9 the same but the struggle takes a mental toll, take damage equal to your instability ignoring armor. On a 6- the connection you have the spirit breaks - the spirit returns to beyond the veil and you take damage equal to your instability ignoring armor.
