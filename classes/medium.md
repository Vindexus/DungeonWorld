# The Medium
The Medium has an attuned connection to the spirit realm, and to the spirits that reside there. Using this connection they can accept spirits into their body for a period of that that grant them boons based on what the spirit was adept at while living.

## Becoming a Medium
 - Be possessed by a spirit, malicious or otherwise
 - Converse with a spirit and earn its trust
 - Help a spirit perform a task it failed to complete in life

## Starting Moves

### Seance
When you take an hour to perform a seance ritual, choose a spirit type from the list below that enters your body and binds itself to you, roll+CHA. 

 - On a 10+ gain 3 parity. 
 - On a 7-9 gain 2 parity. 
 - On a 6- gain 1 parity in addition to whatever the GM says. 

Each spirit type has a domain of influence, as well as a boon that they give you as long as they inhabit you. Once you have spent all of your parity the spirit leaves your body.

- **Charmer**  
Domain: persuasion and manipulation  
Boon: When you converse with an NPC you may spend 1 parity to have them to take a shine to you.

- **Guardian**  
Domain: protection and defense  
Boon: At any time you may spend 1 parity to choose an option from the Defend move.

- **Magi**  
Domain: magic and the arcane  
Boon: When you roll a 7-9 while casting a spell, you may choose to spend 1 parity instead of choosing from the provided list.

- **Mender**  
Domain: healing and restoration  
Boon: When you heal yourself or another, you may spend 1 parity to heal an additional +1d8.

- **Warrior**  
Domain: battle and combat  
Boon: Whenever you deal damage through combat you may spend 1 parity to add +1d6 damage.

>#### For the GM
>Ask the player what the seance looks like. Do they require materials? Are there candles? Do they sit quietly or is there chanting?

>How does it feel when a spirit enters them? What does it look like to someone watching?

### Spiritual Guidance
You may spend 1 parity to reroll any move associated with the domain of the spirit within you. 

## Advanced Moves
If you have the seance move, these count as class moves for you; you can choose from them when you level up:

### Maintain Parity
When you **run out of parity** and attempt to keep the spirit within you, roll+WIS. On a 10+ gain 1 parity. On a 7-9 choose one:

 - Gain 1 parity and take 1d6 damage ignoring armor
 - Gain 1 parity and take -1 forward to Seance
 - The spirit leaves your body 

On a 6- the spirit leaves your body.

### Spiritual Intervention
When **you or a nearby ally would take damage**, you may expel the spirit from your body and use its force to negate the damage.

>#### For the GM
>Make sure to ask how this looks to the outside. Does the spirit trip them up invisibly? Does a white ghost fly from the character's fingertips and block the blade? Is there a burst of white light that disintegrates the incoming arrows?

### Words of Wisdom
When you **consult the spirit that resides within you**, they will give you an insight relating to the current situation, and might ask you some questions in return, roll+CHA. If you are consulting them on a topic of their domain add +1.

 - On a 10+, the GM will give you good detail.
 - On a 7-9, the GM will give you an impression.

>#### For the GM
>Remember that this is a spirit giving them insight, not you the GM. A Warrior spirit might push the character to assault an enemey's fortress immediately while the timing is favorable, but a Charmer spirit might tell the character how they could best convince their enemy to lay down their arms.
>
>When asking the questions in return, try to learn about the character's fears, past, or personality.
