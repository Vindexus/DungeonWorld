# Medium
When you are possessed by a spirit, or converse with one at length, you may consider the Medium a compendium class that is open to you. The next time you level up instead of taking a move from your class, you may take the Medium starting moves.

## Starting Moves

### Seance
When you take an hour to perform a seance ritual, choose a spirit type from Spiritual Affinity you have available. A spirit of that type enters your body and bonds with yours, roll+CHA. On a 10+ gain 4 parity. On a 7-9 gain 3 parity. On a 6- gain 1 parity in addition to whatever the GM says.

### Spiritual Affinity
Your ability to seance is limited to spirits you are compatible with. Choose two types of spirits you are able to seance with. Whenever you are possessed by a new type of spirit, or spend time speaking with a new type, you may consider that type available to you.

- [ ] **Guardian**  
Domain: protection and defense  
Boon: At any time you may spend 1 parity to choose an option from the Defend move.

- [ ] **Magi**  
Domain: magic and the arcane  
Boon: When you roll a 7-9 while casting a spell, you may choose to spend 1 parity instead of choosing from the provided list.
 
- [ ] **Mender**  
Domain: healing and restoration  
Boon: When you heal yourself or another, you may spend 1 parity to heal an additional +1d8.

- [ ] **Warrior**  
Domain: battle and combat  
Boon: Whenever you deal damage through combat you may spend 1 parity to add +1d6 damage.

### Spiritual Guidance
You may spend 1 parity to reroll any move associated with the domain of the spirit within you. 

### Maintain Parity
When you **run out of parity**, roll+WIS. On a 10+ gain 1 parity. On a 7-9 choose one:

 - Gain 1 parity and take 1d6 damage ignoring armor
 - Gain 1 parity and take -1 forward to Seance
 - The spirit leaves your body 

On a 6- the spirit leaves your body.

## Advanced Moves
If you have the seance move, these count as class moves for you; you can choose from them when you level up:

### Spiritual Intervention
When **you or a nearby ally would take damage**, you may expel the spirit from your body and use its force to negate the damage.

### Words of Wisdom
When you **consult the spirit that reside within you**, they will give you an insight relating to the current situation, and might ask you some questions in return, roll+CHA.

 - On a 10+, the GM will give you good detail.
 - On a 7-9, the GM will give you an impression.
