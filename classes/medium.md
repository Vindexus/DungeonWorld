# Medium
When you are possessed by a spirit, or converse with one at length, you may consider the Medium a compendium class that is open to you. The next time you level up instead of taking a move from your class, you may take the Medium starting moves.

## Starting Moves

### Seance
When you take an hour to perform a seance ritual, you invite a spirit to inhabit your body. Choose a spirit type from Spiritual Affinity you have available and set your *instability* to 0. The spirit will leave your body after a day, or if you seance again.

### Spiritual Affinity
Your ability to seance is limited to spirits you are compatible with. Choose two types of spirits you are able to seance with. Whenever you are possessed by a new type of spirit, or spend time speaking with a new type, you may consider that type available to you.

- [ ] **Guardian**  
Domain: protection and defense  
Move: At any time you may gain 1 instability to choose an option from the Defend move.

- [ ] **Magi**  
Domain: magic and the arcane  
Move: When you roll a 7-9 while casting a spell, you may choose to take 1 instability instead of choosing from the provided list.
 
- [ ] **Mender**  
Domain: healing and restoration  
Move: When you heal yourself or another, add +1d4. When healing you may choose add an additional +1d6 and gain 1 instability.

- [ ] **Warrior**  
Domain: battle and combat  
Move: Whenever you deal damage through combat you may gain 1 instability to add +1d6 damage.

### Spiritual Guidance
You may reroll any move associated with the domain of the spirit within you. If you do you gain 1 instability.

### Retain Stability
Whenever you **gain instability**, you must fight to retain parity with the spirit inside you. Roll 2d6 and subtract your instability. On a 10+ you reinforce the bond with the spirit, reduce your instability by 1. On a 7-9 you maintain stability, but only just. On a 6- choose one:

 - Maintaining stability takes a mental toll, take 1 damage ignoring armor for each instability you have
 - The link between your body and the spirit within is severed, the spirit leaves your body

## Advanced Moves
If you have the Seance move, these count as class moves for you; you can choose from them when you level up:

### Spiritual Intervention
When **you or a nearby ally would take damage**, you may expel the spirit from your body and use its force to negate the damage.

### Words of Wisdom
When you **consult the spirit that reside within you**, they will give you an insight relating to the current situation, and might ask you some questions in return, roll+CHA.

 - On a 10+, the GM will give you good detail.
 - On a 7-9, the GM will give you an impression.
