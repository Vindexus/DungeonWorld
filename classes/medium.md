### Spiritual Guidance

### Retain Stability
Whenever you gain instability, you must fight to retain parity with the spirit inside you. Roll 2d6 and subtract your instability. On a 10+ you reinforce the bond with the spirit, reduce your instability by 1. On a 7-9 you maintain stability, but only just. On a 6- choose one:
