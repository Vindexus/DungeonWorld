## Techniques
The following techniques can be applied to your attacks using the [Arcane Honing](#arcane-honing) move.

### Flowing

If your attack kills a target, you may immediately attack a new target as if you had gotten a 7-9 on the appropriate move.

### Freezing

Your attack freezes and shatters a portion of your opponent’s armor. After you deal your damage, reduce their armor by 1 until they repair it.

### Galvanic

Electricity courses through your weapon, numbing one of your target’s limbs.

### Void-Edged

The edge of your weapon hums with an unearthly light. You may slice through inanimate objects with ease and add the ‘messy’ tag to your attack.

### Mirage

You create illusions of yourself that strike additional enemies near your target. Illusions deal your damage but do not apply any techniques.

### Tethering

Your attack pins your target’s shadow to the ground, preventing them from moving more than a few feet from their current location.

### Elaborate

When you apply this technique, roll+DEX.

  - On a 10+, deal an additional 1d8 damage.
  - On a 7-9, this technique has no effect, but it looks really cool!
  - On a miss, your showboating costs you in some substantial way - the GM will tell you how.

### Earthshaker

Your attack concludes with an eruption of stone and earth from the ground, launching your target into the air.

### Burning

Your attack deals an extra 1d4 damage and lights anything flammable.

### Soul-Siphoning

Your attack heals you for 1d4. Heal 1d8 instead if this attack kills your target.

### Torrential

Your attack ends with a flurry of strikes that your opponent must dedicate effort to blocking or avoiding. If they instead attack you in response to your attack, deal your damage again (this does not apply techniques).

### Burst

Your attack deals an additional 1d4 damage and gains the ‘forceful’ tag.

### Quicksilver

Your weapon moves faster than the eye can see, preventing your opponent from mounting a proper defense. Gain +2 piercing on your attack.

### Warding

Your attack creates a ring of light around you and your target that other creatures (and their projectiles) cannot cross.

### Dust Devil

Your attack kicks up a small tornado of dust and grit at your target’s feet, obscuring visibility.
