<p>This is a message you get from Maximus. Either in a letter, via a messenger, a vision, a message in a bottle, or some other means.</p>

<p>If you <strong>read it all</strong> and <strong>send Maxiums a 1-3 sentence response</strong> in character to me via slack you'll get to <strong>mark XP</strong> at the start of the next session.</p>

<p class="no-indent">My Fellow Wardens,</p>
<p class="no-indent">I hope this message finds you well, and if not in safety then at least acting in a way that honors the guild and our martyr.</p>
<p>I present important news, and a request for aid. I beseech you to finish what quest you find yourself on now with the utmost haste, and return to Queen’s Iris.</p>
<p>For the past several months we Wardens have been encountering new and varied threats, and we have come to learn they share a common link: a revived cult known as the <strong>Crescent Hands</strong>.</p>
<p>This group predates the fall of our martyr defeating the Dark Dragon, the founding of our order, and the taming of the Shadowflame beneath Queen’s Iris. Before they faded from history the Crescent Hands were known for their perverse magical experiments and their obsession with mutating living creatures. Wild animals, humans, dwarves, faeries, elves, none were safe. When an experiment proved fruitful the most zealous and senior members of the Crescent Hands would undergo transformations themselves, seeing it as an ascension.</p>
<p>Thanks to the work of some of our bravest members we have discovered a cryptic book called the <strong>Tome of the Chained Soul</strong>. What we have managed to decipher so far tells us of the former leader of the Crescent Hands, a powerful sorcerer known only as the <strong>Lord of Change</strong>.</p>
<p>The Lord of Change was first a powerful sorcer before he founded the Crescent Hands. When he did he used the members and power it brought him to develop new types of mutative magics and sorcery. In preparation for a transformative ritual he was to perform on himself, the Lord of Change managed to capture a most powerful test subject: the angel Azarel.</p>
<p>His tests on Azarel were successful, and the angel was transformed against his will. What happened to him we have not yet learned, but we do know that this action brought the wrath of the angels onto the Crescent Hands. The angels descended to our world in numbers not seen before or since. The angels scattered the Crescent Hands and tracked down the Lord of Change. They were able to trap and bring him down, but could not completely kill him, such was his power.</p>
</div>
<div class="container letter">
<p>Unable to destroy the Lord of Change entirely, the angels split his soul into five pieces, and bound each piece in an artefact held dear by the Lord of Change. Each of the five items, was bound by powerful angelic runes in places of power. We know of three of these items, known as <strong>Artefacts of Change</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>The Staff of the Moon</strong>: found accidentally by Lorgan after a terrible storm, the staff was recovered from Bear’s Hollow. Memoriam Oaky quam memoriam martus.</p>
<p><strong>The Warpsword</strong>: a dark blade with a haft and hilt of bone, it was taken from the Crescent Hands just as they were attempting to free it.</p>
<p><strong>The Twisted Skull</strong>: a humanoid skull, twisted by dark powers, currently en route back to Queen’s Iris from Whitefort.</p>

<p>The remaining two Artefacts of Change we know little about, but as we continue to decipher the Tome of the Chained Soul I hope we will learn more. One thing we do know is that a shard of the Lord of Change resides in each of these artefacts, and any in their presence risks corruption and possession by that remnant of the Lord of Change.</p>
<p>Now, we come to the task at hand, I require the counsel, strength, and honor of all available Wardens. The Crescent Hands are seeking these items, and I fear they are attempting to use them to resurrect their lost leader. </p>
<ul>
<li>What course might we take? </li>
<li>How might we face the Hands? </li>
<li>Do we have the power to destroy these Artefacts?</li>
<li>If not, what must be done with them?</li>
<li>What awaits us should the Crescent Hands revive their Lord of Change?</li>
<li>Might the angels be potential allies?</li>
<li>What other avenues are open to us?</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />

<p class="no-indent">I await your response and your presence in Queen’s Iris.
